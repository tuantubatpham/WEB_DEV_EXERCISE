        The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 
        and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, 
        which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, 
        a very good year for the Midwest region.
